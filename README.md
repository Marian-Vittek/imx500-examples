Raspberry Pi AI Camera Examples.

This directory contains my experiments with Raspberry Pi AI camera. My ultimate goal is to use the camera on a drone for a visual positioning system. After purchasing the camera, I realized that it is quite difficult to start your own development with the available documentation. The simple examples stored in this directory are meant to make this task easier.

At least for the time being, I am not focused on AI and neural networks, but rather I want to use the camera as a visual processing unit. I am also not a Python developer, but it seems that Python and neural networks are the easiest way to get into programming the camera. That is why the examples are written in Python.

Since I do not really understand neural networks and Python, my solutions may be far from good. I'd be glad if someone with a deeper understanding would contact me with suggestions on how to do it the right way.
